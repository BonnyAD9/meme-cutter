# Meme Cutter
Remake of my old MemeCutter (written in C#) in Rust.

This app is for cutting blank areas around images. It is named like this
because its original purpose was to cut blank black areas out of meme
screenshots.

Compared to the old version, this is approx. 13× faster and uses 6× less memory
